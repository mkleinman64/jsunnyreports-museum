You need to use chmod command which is use to change file access permissions as well as to setup an executable permission on file.

General syntax:
chmod +x file-name

For example to setup executable permission on a file called foo.sh (shell script): 

$ chmod +x foo.sh

To execute file: 

$ ./foo.sh

In case for jSunnyreports

chmod +x config.sh
chmod +x config_pause.sh
chmod +x jsunnyreports.sh
chmod +x jsunnyreports_pause.sh

after that the files should be executable with

./config.sh 
./config_pause.sh
./jsunnyreports.sh
./jsunnyreports_pause.sh
